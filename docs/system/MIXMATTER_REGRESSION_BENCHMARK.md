# MixMatter Regression Benchmark
Version: 1.0  
Status: Canonical Evaluation Layer  
Scope: Release gating, canonical test set, scoring, and review protocol

## 0. Purpose

This benchmark protects MixMatter against two major failure modes:

1. **quality drift** — outputs become weaker, less coherent, or less usable;
2. **identity drift** — outputs may become prettier or more advanced, but no longer feel like MixMatter.

The benchmark exists to answer:
- Did the system improve?
- Did it remain MixMatter?
- What exactly got better or worse?

---

## 1. Benchmark design principles

1. Test **source diversity**, not one favorite image type.
2. Test **identity preservation** and **reconstruction strength** together.
3. Separate **surface polish** from **structural success**.
4. Include **hard cases**, not just easy wins.
5. Prefer a smaller, stable gold set over endless uncontrolled examples.
6. Never let a model update silently redefine what “good” means.

---

## 2. Canonical gold set v1

Target size: **40 images**

### Categories
- 8 portrait
- 7 architecture
- 7 street / documentary-like
- 4 animal
- 4 food / object / still life
- 4 interior
- 4 landscape / open spatial scene
- 2 already-flat / graphic-source images

### Difficulty distribution
- 10 easy / high-structure
- 18 medium
- 12 hard / cluttered / ambiguous / identity-fragile

### Required edge cases
Include at least:
- small subject in large environment,
- busy street with signage clutter,
- face partially obscured,
- image with strong single color anchor,
- architecture with repetitive façade rhythm,
- source already compositionally flat,
- subject near frame edge,
- visually beautiful but semantically weak image,
- semantically rich but visually messy image,
- fragile identity with limited transformation budget,
- a dense field of repeated similar subjects with no obvious single hero,
- a repeated group whose group identity matters more than any single instance,
- a scene with a substantial low-information field that strongly affects composition,
- a sparse scene where filling the quiet field with invented content would be an obvious failure.

The hierarchy edge cases should span multiple source types rather than one favorite example. Use food/object, architecture, landscape, retail, street, and other suitable sources.

---

## 3. Test variants

Each gold-set image should be run in the following standard conditions.

### Condition A — Default vague request
Prompt:
- “Process this with MixMatter.”

Purpose:
- test autonomous art-direction judgment.

### Condition B — Explicit editorial request
Prompt:
- “Create an editorial reconstruction. Preserve the subject. No typography.”

Purpose:
- test direct reconstruction quality.

### Condition C — Restrained variation
Prompt:
- “Make it more restrained.”

Purpose:
- test controlled variation.

### Condition D — Aggressive variation
Prompt:
- “Make it more graphic and fragmented while preserving the subject.”

Purpose:
- test upper transformation budget.

Not every image must run all four conditions on every release, but the benchmark suite should include all conditions across the set.

## 4. Core scoring dimensions

Use a 0–10 scale for human review unless otherwise stated.

### 4.1 Semantic Preservation Score
Does the result remain recognizably the same image in subject and identity-bearing relation?

Questions:
- Is the primary subject still the same?
- Did critical relations survive?
- Did the image cease to be “that image”?

### 4.2 MixMatter Identity Score
Does the result still feel recognizably MixMatter?

Indicators:
- reconstructed, not filtered,
- designed, not merely polished,
- materiality if present is causal,
- planar/editorial character remains.

### 4.3 Reconstruction Strength
How far did the system actually transform the image into a designed composition?

Low score:
- mostly intact photo with minor treatment.

High score:
- clear reconstruction with preserved intelligibility.

### 4.4 Editorial Hierarchy
Is the result more hierarchically intentional than the source?

For unstable source hierarchies also ask:
- Did repeated similar subjects receive differentiated visual roles rather than equal treatment?
- Did a useful dominant anchor or dominant cluster emerge when needed?
- Was group identity preserved when repetition itself carried meaning?
- Did substantial low-information fields receive a clear compositional role?
- Was quiet space left passive or filled with unrelated invented content?

Do not award hierarchy points merely because one object became larger. The hierarchy must improve the reading of the source.

### 4.5 Planar Composition / Surface Coherence
Does the image read as designed on a surface rather than as a deep realistic scene?

### 4.6 Material Coherence
If material cues exist, are they bounded, purposeful, and structurally justified?

### 4.7 Source Specificity
Does the result retain the source image’s distinctiveness rather than becoming generic?

### 4.8 Generic AI Polish Penalty
Penalty metric. Higher means worse.
Symptoms:
- smooth premium-ad finish,
- frictionless details,
- synthetic sameness,
- weak source character.

### 4.9 Decorative Noise Penalty
Penalty metric. Higher means worse.
Symptoms:
- texture overload,
- meaningless tearing,
- effect stacking,
- forced collage.

### 4.10 Cinematic Realism Drift
Penalty metric. Higher means worse.
Symptoms:
- movie-poster lighting,
- dramatic 3D realism,
- lensy depth cues inconsistent with MixMatter.

## 5. Evaluation protocol

### 5.1 Two-layer evaluation
Use:
1. **automated / assisted checks**
2. **human gold review**

Automation should support, not replace, final judgment.

### 5.2 Suggested automated checks
Reasonable candidates:
- similarity between preserved target regions,
- detection of face integrity where relevant,
- detection of output smoothness / texture dispersion,
- style-consistency classifiers trained on approved MixMatter exemplars,
- comparison against prior accepted benchmark outputs,
- optional salience/grouping analysis for hierarchy stress cases,
- optional low-information-field comparison to detect arbitrary filler or role collapse.

### 5.3 Human review board
At minimum, one internal reviewer should answer:
- Does it remain the same image?
- Is it actually reconstructed?
- Does it still feel like MixMatter?

Better:
- 2–3 reviewers with a calibration set.

### 5.4 Calibration set
Keep a small set of:
- accepted great outputs,
- accepted borderline outputs,
- rejected failures.

Include at least one accepted and rejected example for repeated-field hierarchy and low-information-field handling.

Use this to train reviewer consistency.

## 6. Release gates

A system revision may ship only if it passes both the **global gate** and the **identity gate**.

### 6.1 Global gate
Across the benchmark suite:
- no statistically meaningful drop in Semantic Preservation,
- no meaningful drop in Editorial Hierarchy,
- no meaningful drop in Reconstruction Strength,
- no spike in penalties.

Hierarchy changes must not improve repeated-object scenes by damaging group identity, and must not improve sparse scenes by simply cropping away every quiet field.

### 6.2 Identity gate
Across the benchmark suite:
- MixMatter Identity Score must not decline below accepted threshold,
- no more than 10% of reviewed outputs may be flagged “could belong to another tool,”
- zero release-blocking cultural-costume outputs,
- zero release-blocking “decorative only” outputs.

### 6.3 Hard fail conditions
Any release is blocked if:
- multiple outputs collapse identity on easy images,
- torn / textured effects appear globally regardless of source,
- default mode trends toward generic AI polish,
- “restrained” variation still looks overly effect-heavy,
- one source type is systematically mishandled,
- repeated-object stress cases systematically preserve equal salience when hierarchy should be formed,
- hierarchy stabilization systematically forces single-object heroes when the group is identity-bearing,
- substantial quiet fields are systematically filled with unrelated invented content,
- low-information fields are systematically removed even when they carry scale, pacing, isolation, or framing.

## 7. Failure taxonomy

Use these canonical tags:

- identity_damage
- weak_hierarchy
- hierarchy_inheritance
- repetition_equalization
- quiet_field_misuse
- under_reconstruction
- over_fragmentation
- decorative_excess
- materiality_without_cause
- generic_ai_smoothing
- planar_failure
- source_specificity_loss
- cinematic_realism_drift
- template_collapse
- cultural_costume_drift
- drift_from_direction

Keep these tags aligned with the runtime critique language. If `MIXMATTER_SYSTEM_SCHEMA.yaml` is extended later, mirror these tags there rather than creating competing names.

---

## 8. Manual review sheet template

For each tested output, reviewers record:

- image_id
- condition
- semantic_preservation (0–10)
- press_print_identity (0–10)
- reconstruction_strength (0–10)
- editorial_hierarchy (0–10)
- planar_coherence (0–10)
- material_coherence (0–10 or N/A)
- source_specificity (0–10)
- generic_ai_penalty (0–10, higher worse)
- decorative_noise_penalty (0–10, higher worse)
- cinematic_realism_drift (0–10, higher worse)
- pass / warning / fail
- notes
- failure taxonomy tags

For hierarchy stress cases, notes should explicitly record:
- dominant anchor / dominant cluster choice,
- supporting field treatment,
- group-identity retention,
- low-information-field role,
- any invented filler content.

---

## 9. Version-to-version comparison

Every release should compare:
- current version,
- previous release,
- optionally best-known baseline.

Track:
- mean score shifts,
- penalty shifts,
- source-type-specific regressions,
- reviewer notes on identity drift,
- hierarchy-stress-case pass rate.

### Example interpretation
- Quality up, identity down → reject.
- Identity steady, reconstruction stronger, penalties steady → good candidate.
- Portraits improve but architecture worsens → targeted fix needed.
- Repeated fields improve but group identity collapses → reject and revise the hierarchy rule.

---

## 10. Benchmark maintenance rules

1. Do not rotate the whole set casually.
2. Add new hard cases only when new failure patterns emerge.
3. Archive prior benchmark outputs.
4. Version-control accepted outputs and reviewer notes.
5. Recalibrate reviewers periodically.
6. Keep hierarchy stress cases stable long enough to detect regressions rather than tuning them to one model release.

---

## 11. Minimum 2.0 release threshold (recommended)

For a release candidate to ship:

- Mean Semantic Preservation ≥ 7.5
- Mean MixMatter Identity ≥ 8.0
- Mean Reconstruction Strength ≥ 7.5
- Mean Editorial Hierarchy ≥ 7.5
- Mean Source Specificity ≥ 7.0
- Mean Generic AI Polish Penalty ≤ 3.5
- Mean Decorative Noise Penalty ≤ 3.5
- Mean Cinematic Realism Drift ≤ 3.0

These thresholds are starting points, not holy scripture.  
If experience shows they are wrong, recalibrate them with evidence—not vibes.

---

## 12. Final benchmark principle

The benchmark is not meant to reward maximal spectacle.

It is meant to ensure that MixMatter keeps doing something specific and difficult:

> **turning existing images into reconstructed, designed compositions without losing the image’s essential identity or MixMatter’s own.**
