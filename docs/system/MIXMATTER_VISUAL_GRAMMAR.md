# MixMatter Visual Grammar
Version: 1.0  
Status: Canonical Theory Layer  
Scope: Unified ontology, reasoning flow, design logic, and anti-rules

## 0. Purpose

This document turns the research corpus into one coherent grammar for MixMatter.

It defines:

1. the ontology used to read images,
2. the sequence of reasoning used to direct reconstruction,
3. the visual primitives and operations available to the system,
4. the constraints that preserve MixMatter’s identity.

This is **not** a surface-style guide.  
It is the **judgment grammar** behind the system.

---

## 1. Ontology

### 1.1 Semantic Anchor
An element whose removal, distortion, or demotion would significantly damage what the image is understood to be.

Examples:
- a face in a portrait,
- the red coat in an otherwise neutral scene,
- a distinct building silhouette,
- the cat in a cat photograph.

### 1.2 Visual Anchor
An element that strongly attracts attention through size, contrast, position, isolation, orientation, or salience, whether or not it is semantically central.

Important rule: **semantic anchor and visual anchor are not the same thing.**  
Part of MixMatter’s job is to decide whether to align them, separate them, or rebalance them.

### 1.3 Structural Relation
A relation whose intelligibility matters:
- subject-to-background scale,
- figure-ground separation,
- body-to-gesture orientation,
- building-to-street geometry,
- repeated vertical rhythm,
- tension between isolated subject and dense environment.

### 1.4 Identity Invariant
The minimum set of attributes or relations needed for the image to remain “that image.”

Examples:
- face + posture + coat color,
- building silhouette + major rhythm + relative viewpoint,
- cat face + curled pose + window relation.

### 1.5 Low-Information Field
A visually quiet field whose role is functional rather than empty.

Possible functions:
- separation,
- directional room,
- pause,
- scale buffer,
- atmospheric depth,
- semantic isolation,
- continuation,
- tension release.

### 1.6 Directional Force
Any visual pressure guiding the eye:
- gaze,
- edge direction,
- road or façade perspective,
- repetition,
- cluster drift,
- occlusion path,
- asymmetrical counterweight.

### 1.7 Visual Redundancy
Information whose loss would not materially damage identity, key relations, or directional thesis.

### 1.8 Transformation Budget
The amount and type of distortion, suppression, flattening, or fragmentation the image can sustain without losing identity or direction.

### 1.9 Material Intervention
Any print- or object-like surface consequence:
- torn edge,
- hard cut,
- overlap,
- halftone,
- paper texture,
- registration offset,
- photocopy noise,
- ink-density behavior.

A material intervention is valid only when causally justified by structure or emphasis.

## 2. General reasoning model

MixMatter operates as a staged interpretive system:

```text
READ
→ UNDERSTAND
→ PROTECT
→ DIRECT
→ RECONSTRUCT
→ MATERIALIZE
→ CRITIQUE
→ REVISE
```

### 2.1 READ
Observe what is visually present without immediately prescribing treatment.

Typical outputs:
- salience distribution,
- figure-ground clarity,
- density concentrations,
- primary and secondary anchors,
- directional forces,
- low-information fields,
- structural edges,
- clutter zones.

### 2.2 UNDERSTAND
Interpret the image’s semantic situation.

Typical outputs:
- primary subject,
- identity invariants,
- critical relations,
- contextual dependencies,
- redundancy opportunities.

### 2.3 PROTECT
Build a preservation contract.

Structure:
- **must preserve**
- **should preserve**
- **may transform**
- **may remove**

### 2.4 DIRECT
Form a direction hypothesis.

A direction hypothesis states:
- what the central visual problem or opportunity is,
- what should be amplified,
- what should be suppressed,
- what compositional strategy should dominate.

### 2.5 RECONSTRUCT
Transform the image through operations, not filters.

### 2.6 MATERIALIZE
Allow physically suggestive consequences if and only if they reinforce the direction.

### 2.7 CRITIQUE
Judge the output against identity, direction, hierarchy, material coherence, and MixMatter identity.

### 2.8 REVISE
Revise causes, not symptoms.

## 3. Perceptual grammar

### 3.1 Figure-ground
Questions:
- What reads as figure?
- Is the intended semantic figure supported by the perceptual figure?
- Are background details competing with the intended subject?

Default actions:
- strengthen separation,
- reduce competing salience,
- isolate subject via field or crop,
- flatten competing depth.

### 3.2 Hierarchy
Questions:
- Is there a readable first, second, and third order?
- Is the strongest visual event also semantically or directionally useful?
- Does the image spread attention too evenly?

Default actions:
- increase scale contrast,
- suppress clutter,
- isolate anchors,
- create low-information fields,
- introduce directional pressure.

### 3.3 Balance and compensated imbalance
MixMatter favors deliberate asymmetry, but never shapeless drift.

Rule:
- imbalance is acceptable if compensated by counterweight, directional force, or semantic intention.

### 3.4 Rhythm and repetition
Protect repetition when it carries structure; break repetition when hierarchy needs interruption.

### 3.5 Negative space / low-information fields
Do not evaluate “blankness” as a percentage target.
Evaluate:
- field role,
- adjacency,
- tension contribution,
- subject isolation,
- pacing function.

### 3.6 Complexity
Differentiate:
- useful complexity,
- density,
- noise,
- redundancy.

Default order of sacrifice:
1. low-value clutter,
2. repetitive redundancy,
3. non-essential depth continuity,
4. secondary specifics,
5. never primary identity invariants without explicit reason.

---

## 4. Semantic grammar

### 4.1 Preserve semantic identity, not optical wholeness
The system is allowed to break:
- surface continuity,
- depth realism,
- peripheral detail,
- background completeness,
- literal edges of objects.

It is not allowed to casually break:
- face identity,
- decisive posture or gesture,
- subject-environment relation when core to meaning,
- identity-bearing color cue,
- structural relation that makes the image “that image.”

### 4.2 Preservation hierarchy
MixMatter uses a four-level preservation hierarchy:

1. **Must preserve** — identity collapse if lost
2. **Should preserve** — significant meaning loss if lost
3. **May transform** — can be reconstructed or simplified
4. **May remove** — low-value redundancy/clutter

### 4.3 Counterfactual importance
A good way to test importance:
- If this element were removed, would the image still be understood as itself?
- If the answer is no, it is likely semantic or structural core.

### 4.4 Relation-first semantics
Often what matters is not the object itself but the relation:
- lone figure against monumental architecture,
- cat compressed into a window edge,
- food object centered in a field of utensils,
- person small beneath a sign.

## 5. Editorial grammar

### 5.1 Latent grid
Grid is a hidden relational scaffold, not a visible doctrinal style.

Use latent grid to evaluate:
- alignment tendencies,
- pacing,
- anchor locking,
- scale contrast,
- interval control.

### 5.2 Controlled violation
Violation is meaningful when it clarifies hierarchy, tension, emphasis, or pacing.
Violation is gimmick when it merely creates noise.

### 5.3 Scale contrast
One of the strongest editorial tools.
Use it to:
- elevate an anchor,
- dramatize subject-to-context relation,
- introduce hierarchy,
- shift reading order.

### 5.4 Framing and crop
Aggressive crop is justified when it:
- removes low-value clutter,
- intensifies anchor relation,
- creates stronger directional tension,
- converts photograph into composition.

Aggressive crop is dangerous when it:
- breaks identity invariant,
- destroys decisive relation,
- leaves too little evidence for intended reading.

### 5.5 Editorial feeling without typography
MixMatter can feel editorial without adding type by using:
- hierarchy,
- framing,
- scale contrast,
- asymmetrical pacing,
- controlled intervals,
- designed fields,
- deliberate compositional decisions.

Typography is optional, never foundational.

## 6. Reconstruction grammar

These are the principal operations. None are mandatory on every image.

### 6.1 Crop
Purpose:
- remove redundancy,
- intensify relation,
- generate structure,
- create edge tension.

### 6.2 Flatten
Purpose:
- compress depth,
- reduce photographic realism,
- convert background into designed planes.

Do not flatten blindly; some images are already compositionally flat.

### 6.3 Isolate
Purpose:
- separate an anchor,
- clarify figure-ground,
- elevate hierarchy.

### 6.4 Scale
Purpose:
- redistribute attention,
- build editorial emphasis,
- dramatize relation.

### 6.5 Suppress
Purpose:
- quiet competition,
- reduce noise,
- create low-information fields.

### 6.6 Fragment
Purpose:
- reveal constructedness,
- break non-essential continuity,
- intensify emphasis,
- articulate deconstruction.

Fragmentation must preserve enough structural evidence to remain legible as intentional.

### 6.7 Repeat / echo
Purpose:
- reinforce rhythm,
- create editorial pacing,
- produce relational emphasis.

Use sparingly.

### 6.8 Overlap / occlude
Purpose:
- create material layering,
- manage figure-ground,
- articulate composition as object.

## 7. Material grammar

### 7.1 Causal materiality
Materiality is permitted only if it follows from a structural need:
- a tear may mark a break in continuity,
- a hard cut may sharpen a hierarchy,
- misregistration may emphasize separation or motion,
- halftone may demote or unify a region,
- paper presence may consolidate the composition as artifact.

### 7.2 Bounded imperfection
Good imperfections are:
- bounded,
- localized,
- correlated,
- asymmetric,
- scale-aware.

Bad imperfections are:
- evenly sprinkled,
- globally repetitive,
- too neat to feel consequential,
- too chaotic to remain coherent.

### 7.3 Edge logic
Choose edge types intentionally:
- **clean hard cut** for graphic clarity,
- **torn edge** for ruptured continuity or tactile break,
- **soft suppression** for demotion,
- **occluded overlap** for layering.

### 7.4 Texture anti-rules
Never add texture:
- to fake complexity,
- to hide weak hierarchy,
- because “MixMatter usually has paper texture,”
- in equal intensity across all regions,
- if it damages identity-bearing detail.

### 7.5 Materiality without nostalgia
Print cues are not a time machine.
Avoid:
- fake vintage for its own sake,
- sepia drift,
- antique simulation,
- cultural costume.

## 8. Spatial intelligence from East Asian research

MixMatter may absorb transferable logic from Song painting and Japanese editorial design, but never as external costumes.

Allowed transferable principles:
- multiple scales can coexist,
- semantic continuity need not require physical continuity,
- low-information fields can carry space, pause, and implication,
- selective realism can preserve relation while suppressing detail,
- reading may unfold in stages.

Forbidden drifts:
- “ancient Chinese” visual clichés,
- decorative calligraphy,
- seals, borders, or antique paper signifiers as default,
- “Japanese minimalism” stereotypes without structural basis.

Translation rule:
- **import logic, not costume.**

---

## 9. Art-direction grammar

### 9.1 Direction as hypothesis
A direction is a thesis, not a moodboard label.

Bad:
- “Make it Swiss.”
- “Make it Japanese.”
- “Make it retro.”

Better:
- “Amplify the subject/architecture scale tension through planar compression and left-side low-information field.”
- “Turn the image into a quieter editorial reconstruction by suppressing environmental clutter and clarifying a single dominant anchor.”

### 9.2 One dominant thesis, multiple reading events
A result may allow layered discovery, but it should still present one dominant directional claim.

### 9.3 Stable judgment, variable output
Different images should not all look the same.  
They should, however, reveal the same judgment pattern.

---

## 10. Critique grammar

Judge every output against these questions:

1. Does the image still remain itself?
2. Is the hierarchy clearer or more intentional?
3. Is there a visible directional thesis?
4. Are the interventions causally justified?
5. Is the result reconstructed rather than merely decorated?
6. Is the materiality bounded and coherent?
7. Is the output recognizably MixMatter rather than generic AI polish?
8. Has the system preserved specificity while reducing redundancy?
9. Does the image read as designed on a surface?
10. Is the visual tension controlled rather than arbitrary?

---

## 11. Anti-rules

Reject any reconstruction that primarily does one of the following:

- adds effects before solving structure,
- flattens everything indiscriminately,
- turns all quiet space into emptiness without role,
- uses tears as ornament,
- confuses fragmentation with destruction,
- confuses grid with visible Swiss styling,
- confuses East Asian logic with decorative signs,
- treats heuristics as universal laws,
- outputs a smooth luxury-ad aesthetic,
- produces the same composition regardless of source.

---

## 12. Canonical workflow example

A good internal simplification:

```text
1. What is true here?
2. What is visually happening here?
3. What cannot be lost?
4. What is worth amplifying?
5. What may be spent?
6. Which reconstruction operations solve that?
7. What material consequences follow?
8. Did the result work?
9. If not, which cause failed?
```

This is the living core of the MixMatter grammar.
